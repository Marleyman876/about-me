            Hi, my name is Garfield Grant, I was born on the island of Jamaica in the year 1991. I served 8 years in the
            United States Military where I learned alot of cool things while traveling and establishing a network of awesome and amazing people. Some of my hobbies include swimmming, learning, getting to know people
            aka networking and listening to music. Some of my favourite beverages are coconut water, coffee, and just
            plain old water.By day I'm
            an Integration and Reporting Consultant, and during the night I enjoy doing things like spending time with
            family, writing code, sleeping and meditating and relfecting on my day. </p>
